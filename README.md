# FlashForge



## Description
For this project me and my group worked together to create a site that allows the user to input, save and view a flashcard.
We used express.js for the functionality and Handlerbars with CSS styling to view the application. The application is deployed using Heroku.


## Usage
This application allows the user to create a flashcard that they can view and edit. 
the user is able to log in and view flashcards they have previously made.
